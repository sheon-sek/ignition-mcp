# Phase 4 — Controlled non-Perspective mutations

Status: **IN PROGRESS** (scope frozen 2026-09-22).

Branch: `feature/phase-4` (user-created; D26 new-branch rule).

Base: `main` at `4de7e37` (PR #5 merge).

This phase implements only D26 Phase 4 / G4. Phases 0–3 are closed and frozen. Nothing here may weaken a G0–G3 guarantee or edit their evidence.

## Authority

1. D01–D30 plus recorded amendments. The primary ones are D07 (Phase 4 amendment), D08, D09, D10, D11 (Phase 4 amendment), D12 (Phase 4 amendment), D16, D17, D18, D20, D21, D23, D26 and **D30**.
2. `CONTEXT.md`, the glossary. Tickets, tests and contracts use its terms.
3. The repo-owned `contracts/` and `tooling/`, and live compatibility evidence.
4. This runbook.

If a decided rule cannot be met as written, stop that ticket, record it under "Open questions", and ask the owner. Never reinterpret a decision silently.

## Goal

Expose D26's Phase 4 Mutation Tools on both Planes. Each goes through the full D08 chain, with D30's Precondition tokens, Preflight and Target allowlists. Close G4 with the D23 L5 failure suite. Every Mutation stays disabled by default: implemented code does not mean a deployment allows it.

## Scope

### Runtime Plane (milestones 4a and 4b)

| Tool | Class | Destructive | Milestone | Precondition token | Verification (Observed state) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tag_write` | CONTROL | no | 4a | — | bounded `readBlocking` of the written paths |
| `alarm_shelve` | CONTROL | no | 4a | — | `alarm_shelved_list` state for the exact paths |
| `alarm_unshelve` | CONTROL | no | 4a | — | same |
| `alarm_acknowledge` | CONTROL | yes | 4a | — | exact-path `queryStatus` (D12 Phase 4 amendment) |
| `tag_update` | CONFIG | no | 4b | Tag config fingerprint | `tag_get_config` re-read |
| `tag_create` | CONFIG | no | 4b | — (existing target → `conflict`) | same |
| `tag_copy` | CONFIG | no | 4b | — (existing destination → `conflict`) | same |
| `tag_delete` | CONFIG | yes | 4b | Tag config fingerprint | target absent |
| `tag_move` | CONFIG | yes | 4b | Tag config fingerprint (source) | source absent, destination present |
| `tag_rename` | CONFIG | no | 4b | Tag config fingerprint | old path absent, new path present |

Additive READ changes: `tag_get_config` emits `fingerprint`.

Profiles (`contracts/profiles/`) are explicit lists, never `*`:
- `operator` adds the CONTROL Tools;
- `configurator` adds the CONFIG Tools;
- `full` adds both.

`readonly` is unchanged. The bundle gets a D21 MINOR bump per released milestone.

### REST Plane (milestone 4c)

| Tool | Class | Destructive | Precondition token | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `config_resource_update` | CONFIG (ADMIN for high-risk types, D07) | no | Resource signature (Gateway-enforced) | re-read |
| `config_resource_delete` | CONFIG | yes | Resource signature (Gateway-enforced) | absent |
| `config_resource_rename` | CONFIG | no | Resource signature (server read-compare) | old absent, new present |
| `config_resource_create` | CONFIG | no | — | present |
| `project_import` | CONFIG | yes | Project fingerprint | D16 export C reconcile |
| `tag_config_import` | CONFIG | no | — (`collisionPolicy=Abort`) | bounded re-export; present/missing Tags as Observed state |
| `alarm_pipeline_cancel` | CONTROL | yes | — | bounded `alarm_pipeline_status` |
| `artifact_delete` | CONFIG | yes | — (retention lock → `conflict`) | artifact absent |

Additive READ changes: `config_resource_get` emits `signature`.

Authentication: the D07 Phase 4 amendment adds named static tokens with per-token scopes. `auth=none` stays read-only.

### Operator tooling (milestone 4d)

`ignition-mcp setup-native apply` writes the managed bundle project, the Server Config for the selected profile and the Runtime Target Policy. Security Levels and the Runtime API token are created only when explicitly requested with flags; the token secret goes only to an operator-named `0600` file. Apply stops on any `BLOCKED` plan line, never rolls back, and ends with `verify` (D20).

## Explicit exclusions

- Re-enabling `alarm_status`/`alarm_journal`.
- `project_create`/`copy`/`rename`/`delete`.
- All Perspective work (Phase 5).
- `install-module` (Phase 6).
- The `DELETE /artifacts/{id}` route (dropped by D30).
- Any Runtime operation-record store or diagnose Tool.
- Dataset and Document `tag_write` values.
- A caller-chosen collision, reference or invalid-reference policy.
- A production candidate builder or generic project-resource editor (D15).
- Promoting any tuple to `SUPPORTED`.
- New error codes.

## Cross-cutting rules

These rules come from D30. The decision holds the full text.

- **Runtime Target Policy.** A Gateway document outside the bundle. It is read by every Runtime Mutation handler and fails closed with `operation_disabled`. It holds Target allowlists per class (provider-qualified prefixes matched at segment boundaries), the Service identity, the audit mode and the shelve cap. UDT definitions need an explicit `_types_` prefix.
- **Preflight.** Every item in a batch passes input, allowlist and Precondition-token checks before any item executes. Items then execute one at a time, with per-item outcomes and no rollback.
- **Fixed knobs.** `references=ABORT`, `allowInvalidReferences=false`, `collisionPolicy=Abort`.
- **Refused resource types.** Contract-listed and refused even under `*`. An unclassified type is refused, and a test fails on any unclassified type in a supported OpenAPI document.
- **Audit.** REST uses the Phase 3 AuditSink ordering. Runtime uses `system.util.audit` with the D18 mode from the policy. `required` checks the audit profile before executing. A failed post-Mutation audit write gives `auditRecorded=false`, never a failure.
- **Fixture first.** Every ticket that touches Gateway behavior adds a recorded-Gateway fixture (`tests/harness/recorded_gateway.py`) or a Jython fixture (D29) that fails locally before any live CI run.
- **Budgets (D10).** `tag_write` defaults to 20 and has a hard max of 100. Config Mutation targets default to 20, hard max 100. The timeout class is FAST unless an artifact is involved, in which case it is ARTIFACT.

## Tickets

Tickets are tracer bullets: each one cuts through contract, schema, implementation, fixture tests, profile and inventory lint, and the live harness. The Issue column links each ticket to its GitHub issue, and GitHub's native issue dependencies hold the blocking edges. Tickets marked **codex** are hard or critical; the rest can go to omp.

## G4 acceptance

G4 closes only when all of the following are true:

- every Tool in the Scope tables is implemented through the D08 chain, with its D30 Precondition token and Target allowlist, and has contract, schema, fixture and live coverage;
- the D23 L5 cases are covered:
  - partial failure, permission denied, oversize, concurrent modification, and audit failure (`required` mode) are proven live on both Planes;
  - timeout, ambiguous outcome and cancellation are proven live on REST through the fault-injecting proxy;
  - on the Runtime Plane the same three are fixture-only, recorded as a limitation in evidence;
- no unsafe automatic retry anywhere; structural tests still confine Gateway writes to the guarded executor;
- inventories are exact:
  - REST Mutation Tools appear only when their class is enabled and the matching capability is present;
  - each Runtime profile's `tools/list` equals its contract list exactly;
  - `readonly` is unchanged;
- Mutations are disabled in the default deployment;
- `setup-native apply` is live-verified with `plan → apply → verify` on a disposable Gateway;
- 8.3.8 required and 8.3.9 candidate rows produce schema-valid evidence, and no tuple is `SUPPORTED`;
- all CI commands are green, and the G0–G3 workflows still pass on the branch head.

## Validation commands

Run the full command block in `AGENTS.md` (Commands) after every ticket. Before spending a live CI run, rehearse locally against `tests/harness/recorded_gateway.py`.

## Open questions

- **Ticket #14 — D30 §7 vs the frozen Phase 3 deployment policy.** D30 §7 maps "target not
  allowlisted" to `permission_denied`; the shared D08 layer answers `operation_disabled`
  (`safety/policy.py::evaluate_deployment_policy`, pinned by
  `packages/ignition-rest-mcp/tests/test_phase3_safety_executor.py:487` and asserted against a live
  Gateway by `tests/harness/phase3-live/driver.py:696`). Ticket #14 implemented the D30 §5 Refused
  resource type rule exactly — `permission_denied`, evaluated inside the chain, even under `*` — and
  left the shared Target-allowlist layer on the frozen Phase 3 code so no G3 artifact changes.
  Unifying the two needs a D30 §7 amendment or a G3 driver change; both are owner-visible, so
  neither was made here.
- **Ticket #14 — no 8.3.9 OpenAPI document is committed.** `contracts/shared/refused-resource-types.json`
  classifies the 8.3.8 document's 57 resource types (39 allowed, 18 refused), and every unclassified
  type is refused, so an 8.3.9-only type is refused at runtime on the candidate Gateway. The
  classification test discovers documents by `docs/ignition-*-openapi/openapi.min.json`, so
  committing an 8.3.9 export fails the test until its types are classified. Producing that export
  needs a live Gateway, which only CI has.
